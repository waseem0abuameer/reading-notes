# Art of README

## Where does the term "README" come from?
The nomenclature dates back to at least the 1970s ,to the days of informative paper notes  "READ ME!"
- **The title README may be a playful nudge
````
The intent is clear: "This is important information for the user to read before proceeding."
````
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
## For creators, for consumers
to write the README to ===> This is an inherent motivation, even if the author has no intent of sharing their work. Once 6 months pass, a module without documentation begins to look new and unfamiliar.
--------------------------------------------

## Many modules: some good, some bad

Plus, discoverability -- as it turns out -- is easier to address.

## Professional module spelunking
1. The README: Your one-stop shop
so you must explain exactly what need your module fills, and how effectively it does so.


## Your job is to:
- tell them what it is (with context)
- show them what it looks like in action
- show them how they use it
- tell them any other relevant details






## Brevity
1. The lack of a README is a powerful red flag
2. The ideal README is as short as it can be without being any shorter. 


## Learn from the past
It is said that those who do not study their history are doomed to make its mistakes again. Developers have been writing documentation for quite some number of years. 

--------------------------------
## Cognitive funneling:
### The ordering of the above was not chosen at random :
1. a predictable format
2. certain key elements present


## cognitive funneling
 ### can be imagined as a funnel held upright
 where the widest end contains the broadest more pertinent details, and moving deeper down into the funnel presents more specific details that are pertinent for only a reader who is interested enough in your work to have reached that deeply in the document. Finally, the bottom can be reserved for details only for those intrigued by the deeper context of the work 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Care about people's time
It's to let them evaluate what your creation does as objectively as possible, and decide whether it meets their needs or not -- not to, say, maximize your downloads or userbase.

-------------------------------------------------

##  Bonus: other good practices
1. Consider including a Background
Finally, please remember that your version control repository and its embedded README will outlive your repository host and any of the things you hyperlink to -- especially images -- so inline anything that is essential to future users grokking your work.
